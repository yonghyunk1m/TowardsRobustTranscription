# Towards Robust Transcription

This repository contains the result of **"Towards Robust Transcription: Exploring Noise Injection Strategies for Training Data Augmentation"** which will be presented in ISMIR2024 Late-Breaking/Demo.

## Exp1: Impact of Noise on Pre-Trained Systems

### Code

### Result
- Inference results of the Onsets and Frames model and the Kong et al. model, evaluated on the white noise-injected MAESTRO test split across varying SNR levels.

## Exp2: Effect of Noise Injection during Training
### Code

### Result
- Inference results for the Onsets and Frames model across different CNR values, evaluated on the white
noise-injected MAESTRO test split at varying SNR levels.
- T-test results CNR=$\infty$ vs CNR={0, 1/3, 1, 3}
